Identify the areas where the existing processes are\nlacking or causing inefficiencies. Explain how the problem aligns with the\norganization's strategic goals.\n•Stakeholder Identification (5 Marks): List and briefly describe the primary stakeholders\nwho will be impacted by the project. Explain their roles and interests in the project's\nsuccess.\nTask 2: Project Scope and Objectives (10 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 16\nth\n May 2025\nIn this task, you will define the scope of the project and outline its key objectives.\n•Project Scope (5 Marks): Clearly define the boundaries of the project. Identify what is\nincluded and exclude from the project scope. Describe any limitations or constraints\nthat might impact on the project's scope.\n•Project Objectives (5 Marks): Define specific and measurable objectives for the project.\nThese objectives should align with addressing the identified problem and achieving\ndesired improvements.\nTask 3: High-Level Requirements and Deliverables (25 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 5\nth\n June 2025\nIn this task, you will outline the high-level requirements of the project and identify the\ndeliverables that will be produced.\n•Explore fact-finding methods (15 Marks): Introduce at least three fact-finding methods\n(e.g. interviews, surveys, observation) that can be utilized to gather information about\nthe organization's processes and requirements. Discuss the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each method, considering factors like time, cost, and accuracy.\n•High-Level Requirements (10 Marks): List the main functional and non-functional\nrequirements for the project. These should provide a high-level understanding of what\nthe solution needs to achieve. Functional requirements define the system's features and\ncapabilities, while non-functional requirements outline performance, security, and user\nexperience criteria.\n\nTask 4: Project scheduling and organization (40 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 28\nth\n June 2025\n•Development Model and Deliverables (15 Marks): Analyze the organization's needs\nand constraints to justify the choice of a specific development model (e.g., waterfall,\nspiral, agile). Highlight the benefits and drawbacks of the chosen model and explain\nhow its phases align with the system's development. Detail the deliverables expected at\neach phase to ensure transparency and effective progress tracking.\n•Gantt Chart (5 Marks): Create a Gantt Chart illustrating the project timeline and\nmilestones.\n•Work Breakdown Structure (10 Marks): Develop a WBS in the specified format,\ndetailing tasks, durations, and task dependencies to ensure a structured approach to\nproject execution.\n•Roles and Responsibilities (10 Marks): Describes the key roles supporting the project.\nTask 5: Peer Evaluation (Individual Submission) 10 MARKS\nRecommended completion: 29\nth\n June 2025\nPlease fill in the evaluation form given below and submit individually to the submission link\ngiven on the HLMS.\nPeer evaluation is a crucial component of teamwork, enabling us to recognize and acknowledge\nthe efforts and contributions of each team member.
