Your primary responsibility is to\nanalyze, design, and implement a computerized information system that aligns with the\norganization’s business objectives and supports its users. The organization has identified the\nneed for an efficient information system to enhance its operations. Your tasks are to lead the\nanalysis and design process for this information system.\nTask 1: Problem Identification and Business Context (15 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 9\nth\n May 2025\nIn this task, you will define the problem that the organization is facing and provide a clear\nbusiness context for the project.\n•Business Context (5 Marks): Provide a comprehensive overview of the organization's\nbackground, industry, and key business objectives. \n•Problem Definition (5 Marks): Clearly describe the problem or challenge that the\n\norganization is currently facing. Identify the areas where the existing processes are\nlacking or causing inefficiencies. Explain how the problem aligns with the\norganization's strategic goals.\n•Stakeholder Identification (5 Marks): List and briefly describe the primary stakeholders\nwho will be impacted by the project. Explain their roles and interests in the project's\nsuccess.\nTask 2: Project Scope and Objectives (10 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 16\nth\n May 2025\nIn this task, you will define the scope of the project and outline its key objectives.\n•Project Scope (5 Marks): Clearly define the boundaries of the project. Identify what is\nincluded and exclude from the project scope. Describe any limitations or constraints\nthat might impact on the project's scope.\n•Project Objectives (5 Marks): Define specific and measurable objectives for the project.\nThese objectives should align with addressing the identified problem and achieving\ndesired improvements.\nTask 3: High-Level Requirements and Deliverables (25 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 5\nth\n June 2025\nIn this task, you will outline the high-level requirements of the project and identify the\ndeliverables that will be produced.\n•Explore fact-finding methods (15 Marks): Introduce at least three fact-finding methods\n(e.g. interviews, surveys, observation) that can be utilized to gather information about\nthe organization's processes and requirements. Discuss the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each method, considering factors like time, cost, and accuracy.\n•High-Level Requirements (10 Marks): List the main functional and non-functional\nrequirements for the project. These should provide a high-level understanding of what\nthe solution needs to achieve. Functional requirements define the system's features and\ncapabilities, while non-functional requirements outline performance, security, and user\nexperience criteria.\n\nTask 4: Project scheduling and organization (40 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 28\nth\n June 2025\n•Development Model and Deliverables (15 Marks): Analyze the organization's needs\nand constraints to justify the choice of a specific development model (e.g., waterfall,\nspiral, agile).
