Upon completion of this coursework, students will be able to: \n \n• CLO2: Construct algorithms to solve computing problems. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCASE STUDY 1 \n \nWrite a pseudocode to calculate the average mark for 8 students’ Networking and Programming \ncourses. The program will use a while loop to accept the Networking and Programming marks for \neach  student,  and  then process all input data.  In  the  end, output the  average  marks  for  the \nNetworking and Programming courses. Refer to the sample output below: \n \n“The 8 students’ average mark for Networking course is 80, and the average mark for \nProgramming course is 90.” \n \nStudents  will  need  to  perform  desk  checking  to  walk  through  the  data  changes  in  the  loop in  a \nWord document. \n \n \nCASE STUDY 2: \n \nStudents are required to develop a simple mobile game application to let kindergarten kids \nnowadays  to  learn  in  their  education (Choose  one  lesson  to  teach  >  Mathematic  /  English  / \nMandarin / Malay). There is no restriction on how the complete mobile application will look like \nin the end, all user interface designs, and processing flow are based on the students’ creativity and \nunderstanding. The system requirements of the mobile application are as follows: \n \ni. The  mobile  app  shall  provide a game  or  application  for  kids  to  learn. (Shooting game, \nsnake, puzzle, collect eggs, etc......)  \nii. The mobile app shall update the 5 highest scores into an online database. If the users score \na  high  score  which  overwrite  one  of  the  5  highest scores,  the  app  shall  play music to \ncelebrate. \niii. The mobile app shall be able to let the users reset the game / application. If users stop / \nreset  the  game  /  application  while  the  game  /  application  is  running,  no  score  will  be \nupdated into the database. \niv. The  mobile  app  shall  let  the  users enter their  name  if  their  score  is  high  and  going  to \n\noverwrite one of the 5 highest scores. \nv. The  mobile  app  shall  be  able  to  display the  top 5  highest scores in  an  ascending  order \n(Apply sorting algorithm to the program).   \n \nTASKS \ni. Construct a pseudocode program to solve case study 1 and complete the desk checking. \nRecommended completion: 10\nth\n July 2025 \nii. Develop a mobile application using App Inventor to solve case study 2. \nRecommended completion: 28\nth\n July 2025 \niii.
