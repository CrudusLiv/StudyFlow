Your primary responsibility is to\nanalyze, design, and implement a computerized information system that aligns with the\norganization’s business objectives and supports its users. The organization has identified the\nneed for an efficient information system to enhance its operations. Your tasks are to lead the\nanalysis and design process for this information system.\nTask 1: Problem Identification and Business Context (15 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 9\nth\n May 2025\nIn this task, you will define the problem that the organization is facing and provide a clear\nbusiness context for the project.\n•Business Context (5 Marks): Provide a comprehensive overview of the organization's\nbackground, industry, and key business objectives. \n•Problem Definition (5 Marks): Clearly describe the problem or challenge that the\n\norganization is currently facing. Identify the areas where the existing processes are\nlacking or causing inefficiencies. Explain how the problem aligns with the\norganization's strategic goals.\n•Stakeholder Identification (5 Marks): List and briefly describe the primary stakeholders\nwho will be impacted by the project. Explain their roles and interests in the project's\nsuccess.\nTask 2: Project Scope and Objectives (10 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 16\nth\n May 2025\nIn this task, you will define the scope of the project and outline its key objectives.\n•Project Scope (5 Marks): Clearly define the boundaries of the project. Identify what is\nincluded and exclude from the project scope. Describe any limitations or constraints\nthat might impact on the project's scope.\n•Project Objectives (5 Marks): Define specific and measurable objectives for the project.\nThese objectives should align with addressing the identified problem and achieving\ndesired improvements.\nTask 3: High-Level Requirements and Deliverables (25 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 5\nth\n June 2025\nIn this task, you will outline the high-level requirements of the project and identify the\ndeliverables that will be produced.\n•Explore fact-finding methods (15 Marks): Introduce at least three fact-finding methods\n(e.g. interviews, surveys, observation) that can be utilized to gather information about\nthe organization's processes and requirements. Discuss the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each method, considering factors like time, cost, and accuracy.\n•High-Level Requirements (10 Marks): List the main functional and non-functional\nrequirements for the project. These should provide a high-level understanding of what\nthe solution needs to achieve. Functional requirements define the system's features and\ncapabilities, while non-functional requirements outline performance, security, and user\nexperience criteria.\n\nTask 4: Project scheduling and organization (40 Marks)\nRecommended completion: 28\nth\n June 2025\n•Development Model and Deliverables (15 Marks): Analyze the organization's needs\nand constraints to justify the choice of a specific development model (e.g., waterfall,\nspiral, agile). Highlight the benefits and drawbacks of the chosen model and explain\nhow its phases align with the system's development. Detail the deliverables expected at\neach phase to ensure transparency and effective progress tracking.\n•Gantt Chart (5 Marks): Create a Gantt Chart illustrating the project timeline and\nmilestones.\n•Work Breakdown Structure (10 Marks): Develop a WBS in the specified format,\ndetailing tasks, durations, and task dependencies to ensure a structured approach to\nproject execution.\n•Roles and Responsibilities (10 Marks): Describes the key roles supporting the project.\nTask 5: Peer Evaluation (Individual Submission) 10 MARKS\nRecommended completion: 29\nth\n June 2025\nPlease fill in the evaluation form given below and submit individually to the submission link\ngiven on the HLMS.\nPeer evaluation is a crucial component of teamwork, enabling us to recognize and acknowledge\nthe efforts and contributions of each team member. This process fosters fairness, accountability,\nand mutual respect within the team.\nDiscussion and Clarification: Feel free to discuss any concerns or disagreements regarding\npeer evaluations with your teammates.

Upon completion of this coursework, students will be able to:\nCLO2: Construct algorithms to solve computing problems.\n\nCASE STUDY 1\nWrite a pseudocode to calculate the average mark for 8 students’ Networking and Programming\ncourses. The program will use a while loop to accept the Networking and Programming marks for\neach student, and then process all input data. In the end, output the average marks for the\nNetworking and Programming courses. Refer to the sample output below:\n“The 8 students’ average mark for Networking course is 80, and the average mark for\nProgramming course is 90.”\nStudents will need to perform desk checking to walk through the data changes in the loop in a\nWord document.\nCASE STUDY 2:\nStudents are required to develop a simple mobile game application to let kindergarten kids\nnowadays to learn in their education (Choose one lesson to teach > Mathematic / English /\nMandarin / Malay). There is no restriction on how the complete mobile application will look like\nin the end, all user interface designs, and processing flow are based on the students’ creativity and\nunderstanding. The system requirements of the mobile application are as follows:\ni.The mobile app shall provide a game or application for kids to learn. (Shooting game,\nsnake, puzzle, collect eggs, etc......)\nii.The mobile app shall update the 5 highest scores into an online database. If the users score\na high score which overwrite one of the 5 highest scores, the app shall play music to\ncelebrate.\niii.The mobile app shall be able to let the users reset the game / application. If users stop /\nreset the game / application while the game / application is running, no score will be\nupdated into the database.\niv.The mobile app shall let the users enter their name if their score is high and going to\n\noverwrite one of the 5 highest scores.\nv.The mobile app shall be able to display the top 5 highest scores in an ascending order\n(Apply sorting algorithm to the program). \nTASKS\ni.Construct a pseudocode program to solve case study 1 and complete the desk checking.\nRecommended completion: 10\nth\n July 2025\nii.Develop a mobile application using App Inventor to solve case study 2.\nRecommended completion: 28\nth\n July 2025\niii.Provide a video to guide users on how to use the developed mobile application.\nRecommended completion: 30\nth\n July 2025\nSUBMISSION CHECKLIST\nSoftcopy submitted through LMS link MUST contains all the following items:\ni.Word document contains your pseudocode and desk checking walk through.\nii.App Inventor back up file (.aia)\niii.Database backup file (depends on which online database you used, if you are using\nOnline TinyDB, then no need)\niv.A video file.\nREMARKS\ni.This assignment should be prepared using word processing software with 12 points Times\nNew Roman font, 1.5 spacing, and page numbering.\nii.If you are not clear about the assignment requirements, please contact the tutor.\niii.You may refer materials from textbooks or any other references, but you must acknowledge\nthe quotation, no matter how brief. Failure to do so will result in zero marks being awarded\nfor the assignment. Refer to the AI generative tools remarks below.\niv.A penalty of 5 marks per working day (including Saturday) deduction from the marks\nobtained for this assignment will be imposed for late submission.\nv.Students will be awarded fail grade if students did not submit any item in the submission\ncheck list."

Upon completion of this coursework, students will be able to:\nCLO2: Construct algorithms to solve computing problems.\n\nCASE STUDY 1\nWrite a pseudocode to calculate the average mark for 8 students’ Networking and Programming\ncourses. The program will use a while loop to accept the Networking and Programming marks for\neach student, and then process all input data. In the end, output the average marks for the\nNetworking and Programming courses. Refer to the sample output below:\n“The 8 students’ average mark for Networking course is 80, and the average mark for\nProgramming course is 90.”\nStudents will need to perform desk checking to walk through the data changes in the loop in a\nWord document.\nCASE STUDY 2:\nStudents are required to develop a simple mobile game application to let kindergarten kids\nnowadays to learn in their education (Choose one lesson to teach > Mathematic / English /\nMandarin / Malay). There is no restriction on how the complete mobile application will look like\nin the end, all user interface designs, and processing flow are based on the students’ creativity and\nunderstanding. The system requirements of the mobile application are as follows:\ni.The mobile app shall provide a game or application for kids to learn. (Shooting game,\nsnake, puzzle, collect eggs, etc......)\nii.The mobile app shall update the 5 highest scores into an online database. If the users score\na high score which overwrite one of the 5 highest scores, the app shall play music to\ncelebrate.\niii.The mobile app shall be able to let the users reset the game / application. If users stop /\nreset the game / application while the game / application is running, no score will be\nupdated into the database.\niv.The mobile app shall let the users enter their name if their score is high and going to\n\noverwrite one of the 5 highest scores.\nv.The mobile app shall be able to display the top 5 highest scores in an ascending order\n(Apply sorting algorithm to the program). \nTASKS\ni.Construct a pseudocode program to solve case study 1 and complete the desk checking.\nRecommended completion: 10\nth\n July 2025\nii.Develop a mobile application using App Inventor to solve case study 2.\nRecommended completion: 28\nth\n July 2025\niii.Provide a video to guide users on how to use the developed mobile application.\nRecommended completion: 30\nth\n July 2025\nSUBMISSION CHECKLIST\nSoftcopy submitted through LMS link MUST contains all the following items:\ni.Word document contains your pseudocode and desk checking walk through.\nii.App Inventor back up file (.aia)\niii.Database backup file (depends on which online database you used, if you are using\nOnline TinyDB, then no need)\niv.A video file.\nREMARKS\ni.This assignment should be prepared using word processing software with 12 points Times\nNew Roman font, 1.5 spacing, and page numbering.\nii.If you are not clear about the assignment requirements, please contact the tutor.\niii.You may refer materials from textbooks or any other references, but you must acknowledge\nthe quotation, no matter how brief.
